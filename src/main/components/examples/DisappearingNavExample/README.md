# DisappearingNavBar

### Description
The 'DisappearingNavBar' component is the same as the HorizontalNavBar component, except it has additional animations where it fades out and slides up when it loses focus. This can allow you to only show the nav bar when it is needed, and perhaps event move your content up to fill the space the nav bar would otherwise use on the screen. 
To utilize this tool,
 - The DisappearingNavBar can be added as a normal Group component to your SceneGraph XML or BrightScript.
 - It contains all of the same fields and behaviors as the HorizontalNavBar component.
